#Project Abroad for Android OS

The development of globalization has opened the doors to a new generation of students to expand their horizons and study in other countries. This raises some problems such as the cost of living in the host country, or the necessity to find proper accommodation during the exchange period.

This project intends to analyse the expected difficulties regarding the accommodation and propose a possible business idea to solve this issue using the most popular technologies by the focused target: Smartphone applications.  In order to do so, a previous brainstorming was carried out to understand the needs to be satisfied, thus understanding the objectives that this project had to achieve.

Once these objectives were set, a prototype of an application was developed and later tested. The results were satisfactory, considering this is only a prototype that should be developed furthermore if this business idea wants to be refined. However, the project also revealed that the number of stakeholders must be considered when developing an application for different segments of customers simultaneously. 

The project acknowledges that it is not enough to build a functional prototype, and therefore an investment in more resources and time should be carried out if a business idea like this one wants to be released to the market.
